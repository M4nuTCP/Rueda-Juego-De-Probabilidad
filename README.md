Probability Game (Roulette)

The Probability Game (Roulette) This code represents a small roulette simulator game. It starts by including some standard libraries and defining functions to display roulette graphics and manage the player's money. It begins by setting variables such as the player's money and configuring the console to support UTF-8 characters. Then, a main menu is presented, offering options to get information about the roulette, play, manage money, or exit the game.

The information section provides historical details about the roulette game. In the actual game, users can place bets on numbers, colors, even/odd, or specific groups of numbers. The code checks if the bets are valid in terms of numbers or bet types and manages the player's balance accordingly.

The roulette simulation is carried out by randomly generating a number between 0 and 36, simulating the roulette spin. The code displays visual roulette graphics and notifies the player if their bet was a winner or loser. The main loop allows the player to continue betting or exit the game. Additionally, the program handles situations where the player's balance reaches zero, indicating they have lost all their money.
